This software has a modular design with two components. Modularity in the design is implemented using one of R's basic basic object oriented methods, the `S3 Class.` 

In a nutshell, there are two dynamical components: 

+ The **M** component describes adult mosquito population dynamics

+ The **L** component describes aquatic mosquito population dynamics

To develop a modular simulation framework, each dynamical component defines a common set of functions that are called. Each module in the class defines its own `S3` method.
